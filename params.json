Please contact us.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nWe currently provide fully functional and completely free edition on Bluemix and while we gain experience with the Bluemix ecosystem and customer expectations have a special support offer for the first three months. During this time support is provided round the clock and for free. Please contact us for any questions or if you want to get walked through a step-by-step  proof of concept implementation. *\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact us at [support@cupenya.com](mailto:support@cupenya.com).\r\n\r\n* After three months the free edition will be reduced in support and enriched with additional support options for professional users. There will always be a free edition available on Bluemix, so you can continue to use the system and data you supply during this period for free afterwards, as long as you stay within the limits.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
